# Product Requirements Document (PRD)

# 1. INTRODUCTION

## 1.1 Purpose
This Product Requirements Document (PRD) specifies the requirements for a Windows Event Simulator tool designed for security testing and training purposes. The document serves as a comprehensive guide for developers, security engineers, QA teams, and stakeholders involved in the development and implementation of the tool.

## 1.2 Scope
The Windows Event Simulator is a specialized software tool that generates synthetic Windows Event Log entries mimicking real-world security vulnerabilities and system behaviors. The system will:

- Create simulated Windows Events that mirror actual security incidents
- Generate events across various Windows Event Log categories (Security, System, Application)
- Produce events with configurable parameters matching known vulnerability patterns
- Support both individual event creation and batch simulation scenarios
- Maintain consistency with standard Windows Event Log formats and structures
- Enable security professionals to test detection mechanisms and response procedures
- Provide a controlled environment for security training and system validation

The tool's primary focus is on security-related events, particularly those associated with common vulnerabilities, privilege escalation attempts, and system compromises. It does not modify actual system events or interfere with existing Windows Event logging mechanisms.

# 2. PRODUCT DESCRIPTION

## 2.1 Product Perspective
The Windows Event Simulator operates as a standalone application within the Windows operating system environment. It interfaces with the Windows Event Log architecture but maintains isolation from the actual event logging system to prevent interference with genuine system events. The tool functions as part of the broader security testing ecosystem, complementing existing security information and event management (SIEM) systems, intrusion detection systems (IDS), and security monitoring tools.

## 2.2 Product Functions
- Event Generation
  - Create synthetic Windows Event Log entries across Security, System, and Application logs
  - Support both single event and bulk event generation
  - Configure event parameters including Event ID, Source, Level, and custom fields
  - Generate events based on predefined vulnerability templates
  - Support temporal event sequencing and correlation

- Event Management
  - Save and load event generation configurations
  - Export generated events in standard Windows Event Log formats
  - Schedule automated event generation scenarios
  - Maintain an audit trail of generated events

- Template Management
  - Create and modify event templates
  - Import templates from existing event logs
  - Categorize templates by attack type and MITRE ATT&CK framework
  - Version control for templates

## 2.3 User Characteristics
1. Security Engineers
   - Advanced knowledge of Windows Event Logs
   - Experience with security testing and validation
   - Familiarity with common attack patterns and vulnerabilities
   - Primary use: Testing detection rules and security controls

## 2.4 Constraints
1. Technical Constraints
   - Windows OS compatibility (Windows 10 and Server 2016 or later)
   - No modification of actual system events
   - Limited to Windows Event Log format specifications
   - Must maintain separation from production logging systems

2. Security Constraints
   - No elevation of system privileges
   - No interference with existing security controls
   - Clearly identifiable simulated events
   - Secure storage of templates and configurations
