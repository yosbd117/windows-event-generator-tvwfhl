## Security Guidelines

### Event Generation Safety

1. **Environment Isolation**:
   - Use in isolated test environments only
   - Never deploy in production environments
   - Maintain separate networks for event simulation

2. **Resource Protection**:
   - Monitor system resource utilization
   - Implement resource usage limits
   - Enable automatic shutdown on threshold breach

3. **Access Control**:
   - Implement least privilege access
   - Use role-based access control
   - Regular access review and audit

### Secure Template Management

1. **Template Validation**:
   - Validate all templates before use
   - Implement integrity checks
   - Maintain template version control
   - Mandatory security review for new templates

2. **Storage Security**:
   - Encrypt template storage using AES-256
   - Implement secure backup procedures
   - Regular integrity verification
   - Access logging and monitoring

### Integration Security Requirements

1. **API Security**:
   - TLS 1.3 required for all endpoints
   - Strong authentication required
   - Rate limiting implementation
   - Regular security scanning

2. **Authentication**:
   - Multi-factor authentication for administrative access
   - Token-based API authentication
   - Regular credential rotation
   - Session management controls

### Data Protection

1. **Encryption Requirements**:
   - AES-256 encryption for sensitive data
   - TLS 1.3 for data in transit
   - Secure key management
   - Regular encryption audit

2. **Audit Requirements**:
   - Comprehensive audit logging
   - Tamper-evident logging
   - Regular log review
   - Secure log storage

## Security Update Process

### Severity Levels and Response Times

1. **Critical**:
   - 24-hour response
   - Emergency patch release
